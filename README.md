# Nocturne Records
### 🎧ྀི♪⋆.✮ Project Description
Nocturne Records is a API created music store for vinyl lovers and audio gear collectors. I helped an existing web application grow into a stable platform by improving the security for admin routes as well as fixing bugs in the existing code.


Security: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authenticated sessions and role-based access.
### Bug Fixes 𓆣
Resolved issues where the record search returned incorrect results. Now, customers can filter by category, price range, and subcategories.
Fixed a bug in the ProductController class, specifically the updateProduct method.
